## 📈 T-Test: Delivery Days vs. Return Rates

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Delivery days have no impact on returns  
**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Longer delivery days lead to more returns  
➡️ **Result**: P-value < 0.05, **reject H0**  
**Conclusion**: There is a statistically significant link — longer delivery times increase the chance of returns.
